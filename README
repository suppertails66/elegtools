This package contains the source materials (code/art/script) for the English
translation project for the Game Gear game Eternal Legend.

                    ****************************************
                    
The build system is only set up for Unix-like systems, though none of the code
is fundamentally dependent on this and could be ported with a bit of effort.
You'll need GCC, libpng, and any dependencies of wla-dx. Make sure to check out
submodules when you clone the repository.

You'll first need a ROM image of Eternal Legend for the Game Gear. It should
match the following specifications:

  No-Intro filename: Eternal Legend - Eien no Densetsu (Japan).gg
  CRC32:             04302BBD
  MD5:               C58D6291DA8A4919328B8F42BE8640A7
  SHA-1:             717B4E33CF3956E4194B912533BF1B7BF9D20725

Rename it "eleg.gg" and place it in the "eleg" folder. Then:

$ cd eleg
$ ./build.sh

build.sh should then build all the necessary tools and output the translated
ROM as eleg_en.gg.

If you want to modify the project, check build.sh to see where the resources
that get inserted into the game are coming from.
